# Master in MPC Framework Project 
Building a new outcome based framework of a Masters in MPC (Media, Product &amp; Community) for creators as an alternative to MBA 

MastersInMPC is an open project for creators to collaborate and build an outcome based framework for young talent to clearly understand how to go about building which can help them grow in career. 
Think of it like an Martial Arts school but completely online. 

**Step 1**: People choose a level they want to master and try to accomplish outcomes in that level. 

**Step 2**: Once they choose a level, they will pick up projects which will help them deliver that outcome. 

**Step 3**: They will get support from the community, coaches and algorithm to get curated resources & support to complete the project 

**Step 4**: They complete a level which is on part with the Industry standards. Level 8 of MPC should be equivalent to senior roles at startups for jobs or High paid gigs as freelancers. 

Let's collaborate in building an outcome based framework which you think will be cool for someone to work.

To make this easy I have documented the first 4 levels. Check the repo for word file  called **outcome framework for masters in mpc** or you can click here
